It seems like I still need to nail down what gets me motivated to work on a side project outside of a hackathon.
At a hackathon everyone is pumped to make and so it pumps me up! The environment and people form a perfect storm for 
making new things. It's a great setting and I love it, but I find it difficult for me to do things on my own
once I'm on break. Distractions at home are easily accountable, but in some cases it's not even that. 
During this break I tried to code my own project idea, but for some reason something didn't feel right.
I felt anxiety with each clack of the keyboard. What was wrong? The project itself wasn't inherently difficult.
I knew the implementations that I needed and I've done some permutation of all the features. It then hit me
that I had anxiety because it was tedious and I wasn't learning anything new. At that point I was just wasting
time and not having fun so I scrapped the project after finishing the chat module. Okay! Gonna learn something new!
I recieved an easy to read Haskell book for Christmas and I set that as my goal for break. Learn some Haskell!
...but I still haven't actually cracked open past the introduction! What was wrong? It was new and exciting,
but why did all of these distractions like Reddit and anime seem so much more important at the time? If I truly
wanted to learn Haskell I would have by now...right? So does that mean I'm just a lazy bum who's all bark
and no bite? Well... I guess there is some truth to that. The hump before starting a new project or going
into a new frontier always seems more like a mountain than a speed bump. Simply starting is the biggest hurdle,
but I wonder why that happens. Not just side projects, but assignments, essays and more seem so much more difficult
before starting. I guess that's just me going through paralysis of fear and worry about it being boring or tedious. 
This rant was fairly pointless but it was nice to get it off my chest (as well as put off reading my book a bit more).
I think that I need to start being more bold and brash. Take a leap of faith once in awhile, it can't be nearly as
bad as I think it will be. Every time I put off a project or a goal it's just a wasted opportunity because I could
be using that time to start something new!
