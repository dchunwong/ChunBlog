I am entitled. Or am I privileged? Probably both. All-in-all I know I can, and often, come off as pretentious and bougie to others. I have been painfully aware of this fact since high school, and more so in college, but I still can't seem to shake it off. I know consciously I come off as obnoxious, but I still do it. I think one problem is that I seek attention and so one way of doing that is simply to show off, which is <em> terrible. </em> I suppose this sort of stems from a little too much "special snowflake" treatment about how you're the best or unique in combination with a little too much video games and anime about "chosen ones" who are natural geniuses that can do anything well. I know the reality is that I'm pretty average at everything and that very few people can do things incredibly well without practice. I am not one of those people. But how do I get this sort of romanticized delusion about my personal abilities out of my head? A lot of cases I feel like I deserve things that I probably do not deserve. "Oh he got the internship when I should have" even though I didn't actually put that much effort in. It's infuriating to myself that I think this way even though I consciously know it's a terrible thing to do. I want to be a more humble person who doesn't brag about everything, but why haven't I become that person yet? I guess I really don't want to change that much after all huh... I suppose that admittance of a problem is the first step to solving it, but what else can I do? Changing my behavior is like changing a bad habit, it's kind of hard to kick. With that defeatist attitude though I'm not going to change anything! I need to be more mindful and aware about the world and people around me and to not just <em> act </em> less privileged and entitled but <em> be </em> less so! I guess in this post I sort of addressed two personal problems, I feel entitled to things, and I often wave things in people's faces. In a way I'm acting privileged right now, huh? Writing a post complaining about it instead of just doing something about it... as if that would help other than reminding people something they already know. I am a good person really! I just want to be likable and not so...pretentious.</br></br> <strong>Be aware! Be empathetic! Be humble! Continually work towards improvement instead of settling! Everything must be earned, but don't show it off! No one owes you anything so stop complaining and do something!</strong></br></br>P.S. Sorry if I used entitlement and privilege incorrectly!
