Hello, if you are reading this, congrats! This is my first post on my very simple development blog. Though it may not have all the fancy schmancy features of a <strong>Wordpress</strong> or <strong>Blogger</strong> I feel like it will get the job done with basic html stylings. The point of this blog is to track my own progress as well as vent my thoughts as I try and create more and more side projects. <br>P.S. I realized that I don't actually need to check if there's a new post every time the page is loaded as heroku will need to stop and reload the app anyways!
