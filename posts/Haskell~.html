Learning a new language has always been pretty fun, whether it was the exhilaration of writing a simple "Hello World" in Python for the first time or seeing my C project reach hundreds of gigaFLOPS through the use of multithreading there's always some sort of gratification in the fact that something I made is operational! Even the failures, though frustrating, were in a way nice once they were resolved because I usually learn something about either a) my sloppy coding style or b) a nuance of the language I didn't know before. While I've learned languages through structured classes, Python, Java, and C, as well as through experimentation, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, <em> Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! </em> is my first foray into guided self-learning, and I have to say I'm a fan. The writing is simple and easy enough to follow, and even when I was reviewing concepts I've learned in earlier classes I was still learning about Haskell. I guess what I'm trying to say is... I'm excited about learning from the book! Rather than reading over things and saying I understand them I actually go back and make sure I <strong> know </strong> how the example code works and <strong> why </strong> it works that way. I guess that is to say I'm actively reading and incorporating. While going through the book I've been writing my own notes which I go back to often as well as work through these <a href = http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions/>99 Haskell Problems </a> which I find are good for review and getting the basics down.<br> I've absolutely fallen in love with pattern matching as it makes me think differently from normally. I'm still trying to get into that recursive mindset though. Folds are also another cool implementation that I need to take more advantage of. Haskell syntax to me is easy to understand and write, and I hope that I'll definitely be able to use it in a project soon.
