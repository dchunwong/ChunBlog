I did something very stupid today. I made a few joke comments complaining about non-issues on a friend's website that he let me into alpha. Though some of it was to test it out, it got out of hand when I directly complained (jokingly) on one of my pictures. The problem is that even if I was joking that is never okay. I know how I get hurt whenever someone jokingly says something bad aout my project, and so of course he would feel somewhat similar. My problem is even though I always write about how life is all about gathering different perspectives, I have trouble equipping those perspectives properly. I should've put myself in his shoes and seen what he might have felt. It's times like these I really kick myself because it's just simple common sense and something that I've learned time and time again. I've had plenty of times where I've gotten mad at friends because of some light joking remarks, I worked hard on it and I want to be treated like it's a legitimate thing so why would I do the same to someone else. My severe lack of empathy or simply walking a mile in a man's shoes hurts. I guess though I shouldn't kick myself too hard about it, but I should keep it in mind so that I can always remember to just not be a dick! Saying "Oh just kidding!" doesn't really make anything better, and I should know that because I chided someone about that in my high school film class. <strong> I guess what I'm trying to say is even if some problems are the same when reduced, I have trouble putting them in the right perspective to solve them. </strong> This seems to be something that's applied to me in all walks of life, particularly math and proofs. Sometimes everything is just a matter of perspective. <p> On another note I've been feeling particularly sad recently. A string of events have sort of left me in a depressed state when thinking about them. I've always found though that laying in the grass and staring at the stars cheers me up and lifts the weight off my chest. I guess it's because it reminds of my times in boy scouts. The most memorable part were the starry nights spent just looking up over the vast sky and seeing a sea of stars twinkle endlessly into the horizon. It's the sort of endless void full of light that makes me forget everything about life. I feel liberated and imagine myself floating amongst the endless stars all around. The feeling of being in nature is one irreplaceable by anything in the city. The swaying grass, the glistening lake, but most of all the sea in the sky all make me forget my worries and feel at peace. Looking up at the stars is all I can do to take me back to those days when I could forget about the stress of life and simply be. </p>
